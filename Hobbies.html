    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>My Hobbies are swimming. During my leasure time I like to travel<br> 
and explore new places. I also enjoy reading books, especially fiction and history.
I find it fascinating to learn about different cultures and perspectives through literature.
I also like to cook and experiment with new recipes, which allows me to express my creativity in the kitchen.
